# cryptofetch

Very early implementation of API and commandline tool for asynchronously fetching cryptocurrency information.
Current commit has finished the interface for fetching information asynchronously from Coinmarketcap, Bittrex and GDAX. there's also an early implementation of the commandline parser

Will be implementing as a package as soon as some commandline usecases are finished.


BittrexHandler and CmcHandler currently fetch raw JSON information asynchronously with no problems.
